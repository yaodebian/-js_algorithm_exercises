# Chapter01_String01_Reverse

## Question

Given a 32-bit signed integer, you need to reverse the digits on each bits in this integer.

## Analyse

## Complexity

| Method Code | Time complexity | Space complexity | remark |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| method01    | `O(n)`          | `O(n)`           |        |
| method02    | `O(n)`          | `O(1)`           |        |

Max length of the num is 10. So we can also consider the time complexity or the space complexity is `O(1)`.
